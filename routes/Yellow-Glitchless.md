# Yellow Any% Glitchless - Ice Beam Route
This guide assumes you know general movement through the route (which trainers to fight, how to get through safari zone, etc.)
It's not possible to write down everything about how to move, so it is highly recommended to watch a run using this route before attempting a run.
Two examples here: https://youtu.be/3cT6Ikssn2s  https://youtu.be/90VmIySFnyY

Abbreviations: HA = Horn Attack, DK = Double Kick, BB = Bubblebeam, TB = Thunderbolt, HD = Horn Drill, EQ = Earthquake, IB = Ice Beam
